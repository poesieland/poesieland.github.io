## Site history
- 2025: opening of a [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61584635947640), in French, but comments are welcome in any language, to be able to interact with my readers.

- 2023: abandoning hand-made stuff, website now uses *Hugo* as a site building framework and *hugo-theme-relearn* for theming (see [Credits](../more/credits/)). New back-office tool to generate content pages (XML to markdown). Opening on first October and progressive input of poems written since 2004.

- 2005: use of XHTML 1.1 strict to replace HTML 4.01 transitional. Started working on a visual back-office tool but never achieved it.

- 2004: modernization of HTML structure (floating divs)

- 2003: XML offline generation allowed to better structure the French part.

- mid-2001: site opening.
