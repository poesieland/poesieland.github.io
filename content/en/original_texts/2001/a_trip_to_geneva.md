As if I were feeling home,

A dream that wouldn't go broken...

 \
Smiling in my heart, stepping in these streets,

Some of them narrow, but widened by history,

Where people raised stones and arts...

 \
I wouldn't go to your lake, Geneva,

Cause I saw it through the clouds,

But the soft wind of your soul

Wraps around me, making my heart

Feeling world-open in this Christmas morning.
