When a stars comes shining,

Do you notice it at first?

When a light disappears,

Do you feel its soft wind?

 \
When a dreams infiltrates

In your soul, you were sleeping,

You awake, it's still here.

You wait, you touch it.

 \
And slowly you become

Another soul, another dream

Yourself. You are alive,

You are wiser, wider,

 \
You know this light,

You knew it before,

But you were blind, before

The right moment came.
