Just a voice

Near the heaven,

Just a voice,

Whispering

And suddenly taking out all its soul,

My soul,

His soul...

 \
Just a voice

Singing words,

Just a voice

Singing worlds,

 \
An old voice,

Filled with dreams,

A young voice,

As a heartbeat.

 \
A voice I want,

A voice I know

And listen to,

With a new wonder,

I couldn't stop

Against my will.

 \
Thanks for your voice,

Sweet hidden dream

Beyond our world.
