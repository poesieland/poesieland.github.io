First steps of a path,

First song of a bird.

The sun breezes around your world,

Immaturity of the morning.

 \
I'll praise the goodness of the creator

Because time has no meaning.

My heart is weak, my dreams are foul

But there is no reason to loose.

 \
I know I never listen fully

To your advice or to your truth.

I may not change, I may not live.

First steps into... what then?
