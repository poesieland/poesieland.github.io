When you close your wide eyes,

Little one, little man,

Do you dream of stars in skies?

 \
When you close your wide eyes,

Little one, little man,

Do you dream the world in touch,

Do you feel this summer wind?

 \
When you close your wide eyes,

Little one, little man,

You will grow, learn by steps,

You will open them again,

After a rest, just to find love...

 \
When you close your wide eyes,

Little one, little man,

And this world that will be yours,

You can dream nicer future,

 \
You can dream, you can cry,

Mom is proud, so is dad,

Sleep in peace, little man.
