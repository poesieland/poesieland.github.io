I walk in next district shadowed streets

Which I barely know,

Gently sweating in growing Spring.

At quick steps, my mind flows

Under the nice newborn green on the branchs above.

 \
I pass along mothers with small children

And my heart is full of wellfeelness:

I want to marry you next summer, darling...

 \
I bought a pair of fresh baked croissants,

Sweet smell swirling at either street's corner.

 \
I could not enjoy life more than I do yet,

Walking under lime and rosewood trees.
