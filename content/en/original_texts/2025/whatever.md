Whatever you try,

Wherever you go

You don't know why

There's so much snow.

 \
Whatever you find

And they do meanwhile

Look at your mind,

Why do you smile ?

 \
Whatever you leave

Come on to the light,

Come on, believe

After the night.

 \
Whatever you think

Today you're reborn,

Come on, unsink

And play your horn.

 \
Whatever you gain

Bet it just a pound,

Life goes again

With a new sound.

 \
Whatever you dare,

Whatever you want,

Life does not scare,

Nothing you can't.
