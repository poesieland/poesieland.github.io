# POESIELAND

Personal poetry website of Barbara Post, editable content which is used with Hugo static site generator and custom theme.

---
This repository uses one other repository as Git submodule:

- the Hugo Theme Relearn theme project, following main development: [https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn)

I especially use Chart.js as a helper library added to theme that has nice integration capabilities.

And two other repositories for statistics management and compact storage:

- this website's back-office tools: [https://github.com/postb99/poesieland_back-office](https://github.com/postb99/poesieland_back-office)

that is locally cloned next to this project in "back-office" folder. Current project is locally cloned in "site" folder.

- this website's back-office data (private project): [https://github.com/postb99/poesieland_storage](https://github.com/postb99/poesieland_storage)

that is locally cloned next to this project in "back-office-data" folder.
